# BigQuery XGBoost with Feature Engineering Model (Final Submission).ipynb
In this dataset exploration, a XGBoost model was used to analyze the price of wines in the US, a subset of the entire dataset.

# Final Takeaways
Within a relatively short time, the XGBoost model was able to give respectable results with minimal data exploration and analysis. The model could've been developed further, but I found it difficult to share code on Kaggle, impeading development.
